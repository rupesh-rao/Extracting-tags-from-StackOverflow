# Extracting different tags from StackOverflow website.

In this project I have used python to scrap website. I have taken Stackoverflow website and scraped it extracting different kinds of tags available in Stackoverflow. 

I have used Urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries to open and parse the website respectively. I have saved the data extracted in a .csv file. I have scraped through 1538 web pages to extract 55348 tags.
